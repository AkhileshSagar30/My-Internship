<h1>My First Interneship Experience</h1>

As a part of our Univerity Internship Program(IP-1), during my 2nd year Summer Intership I was selected as an intern for the company INTENSEL | Hong Kong . It was my first experince and we had to create a portfolio on Carbon-Emmisons.
Even though my contribution was just a small part for this project, I enjoyed programming in python as it was my first time doing this kind of work.
We were a group of five with a faculty assigned to monitor us. Initially we were given with excel files which had some the details regarding the company, and we were told to get the Revenue, Market Capital of the company, their Head-Quaters location(Address & Coordinates) along with some carbon emmission details.
Later plot the locations of the company & their carbon emmisions on the map, and create CSV files of the Data.
For this:
We did programming in Python and mainly used various python libraries like: Pandas & GeoPandas, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Matplotlib.
During this intership we faced various difficulties but with proper team work and coordination we crossed the obstacles.
